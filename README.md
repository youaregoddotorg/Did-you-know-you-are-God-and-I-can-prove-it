i have no clue what I'm doing. im really just trying to find why the government has me under state sponsored monitoring. it's been 10 straight years of civil privacy violations for absolutely no reason. a judge has been kicked off the bench yet I'm still a super big attraction over at the NSA and DoD apparently and no one will tell me why, who, when, what, or where. what did i do?
